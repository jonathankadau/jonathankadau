      <h1>WHO AM I</h1>

      <p>
        I am an architectural designer currently studying at SCI-Arc. My work
        explores the relationship between form, systems, and infrastructure,
        often through speculative and diagram-driven projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am interested in architecture as a tool that operates beyond buildings,
        engaging logistics, territory, and political systems. My projects frequently
        examine how architectural form can both organize and reveal hidden processes.
      </p>

      <p>
        This portfolio is a curated selection of academic work, research, and
        experimentation across drawing, modeling, and representation.
